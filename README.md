# diabetes_progression_after_one_year

The purpose of this project is to use diabetes data from the “lars” library to examine the effect of ten human biological predictor variables upon a quantitative response variable that is the measure of disease progression after one year. During this project, we will examine the data using exploratory data analysis, employ machine learning techniques to fit linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso models, and incorporate best subset selection and cross-validation. We will then present our results and draw conclusions on our analysis and the applicability of the various machine learning techniques upon the diabetes data.
